excerpt: 'Backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) face challenges
such as lower attack success rates and compromised main
task accuracy (MA) compared to local training. Existing
methods like distributed backdoor attack (DBA) mitigate
these issues by modifying malicious clientsâ€™ updates and partitioning global triggers to enhance backdoor persistence and
stealth. The recent full combination backdoor attack (FCBA)
further improves backdoor efficiency with a full combination strategy. However, these methods are mainly applicable
in small-scale FL. In large-scale FL, small trigger patterns
weaken impact, and scaling them requires controlling exponentially more clients, which poses significant challenges,
while simply reverting to DBA may decrease backdoor performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose the
self-adaptive distributed backdoor attack (SADBA), which
achieves similar performance to FCBA with a lower percentage of malicious clients (PMC). It also adapts more flexibly through an optimized model poisoning strategy and a
self-adaptive data poisoning strategy. Experiments demonstrate SADBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher or comparable backdoor performance and MA
across various datasets with limited PMC.'
