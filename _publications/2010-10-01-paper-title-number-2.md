title: "BadMSSL: Audio Backdoor Attacks on Mask-Based Self-Supervised Learning"
collection: conferences

permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Modern automatic audio systems, such as environmental sound recognition and speech command recognition, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Current supervised audio models face the challenge of limited labeled data. Thus, recent research has proposed self-supervised learning (SSL), which involves pretraining on large-scale unlabeled data and fine-tuning on smaller labeled data. While SSL is inherently resistant to direct data tampering, recent works have revealed its vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks. However, most previous backdoor attacks on SSL focus on contrastive-based SSL, with little attention paid to mask-based models in the audio field. To fill this gap, we propose BadMSSL, the first backdoor attack designed specifically for mask-based self-supervised learning models in the audio domain. Our method introduces Trojan samples during the pretraining phase, enabling the model to learn both target class features and backdoor-specific patterns. By constructing backdoor tasks and embedding malicious features, BadMSSL injects a backdoor into the SSL pretraining model such that the downstream model built on it simultaneously inherits the backdoor behaviour. Our experiments demonstrate that existing mask-based SSL audio models are vulnerable to BadMSSL while achieving a main task accuracy of up to 98.31%. Additionally, we find that directly adapting supervised backdoor attack methods to SSL frameworks results in suboptimal performance. Extensive ablation studies further confirm the robustness of BadMSSL across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and resilience in audio applications.'

Modern automatic audio systems, such as environmental sound recognition and speech command recognition, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Current supervised audio models face the challenge of limited labeled data.
