excerpt: 'This paper proposes a new audio backdoor attack method to address the security issues of multi-channel audio signals in the audio field. This method utilizes multi-channel microphones to receive audio signals, which generate different time delays and phase differences for signals from different directions, achieving covert backdoor injection in a physical environment. Through this approach, efficient backdoor injection has been successfully achieved, and inheritance can be carried out without affecting downstream tasks. This method uses a directional difference trigger to activate backdoor attacks only in specific directions, thereby guiding the model to output expected results under the control of the attacker. This study proposes a novel physical audio backdoor attack aimed at revealing the security risks that audio domain models such as speech recognition may face, and providing new ideas for enhancing the security of self supervised learning and speech analysis models in the audio domain.'

Through this approach, efficient backdoor injection has been successfully achieved, and inheritance can be carried out without affecting downstream tasks. This method uses a directional difference trigger to activate backdoor attacks only in specific directions, thereby guiding the model to output expected results under the control of the attacker. This study proposes a novel physical audio backdoor attack aimed at revealing the security risks that audio domain models such as speech recognition may face, and providing new ideas for enhancing the security of self supervised learning and speech analysis models in the audio domain.
