I am a third-year M.S. student at [School of Cyberspace Security](http://cse.hust.edu.cn/) of [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jun Feng](https://junfeng989.github.io/).  I received my B.Eng. degree in data science and big data technology from the School of Computer and Communication Engineering at Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, China, in 2023.

My research interest includes Privacy Security, Adversarial Attacks, Federated Learning, Audio Processing and Self-supervised Learning. My current work focuses on advanced topics in AI security, Multimedia, Multimodal Learning and Backdoor Attacks, with an emphasis on applications that bridge theory and practice.

I am deeply passionate about exploring new ideas and approaches, always maintaining a strong enthusiasm for learning and optimizing methods to tackle concrete challenges. My academic and professional journey has been driven by a commitment to continuous improvement, a solid ability to self-learn, and resilience under pressure. I thrive in collaborative environments and value teamwork as a cornerstone of success.

Beyond my core research interests, I am eager to engage with peers from interdisciplinary fields. I believe that cross-disciplinary collaboration is key to addressing complex, high-dimensional problems and achieving system-level optimization. I welcome opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals, exchange ideas, and grow together.
