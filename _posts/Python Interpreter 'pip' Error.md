The error message `Try to run this command from the system terminal. Make sure that you use the correct version of 'pip' installed for your Python interpreter located at ***` may occur due to
a conflict between domestic pip sources (e.g., Tsinghua) and international sources. Disabling the VPN may resolve the issue.
